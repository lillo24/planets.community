# Local verifier helpers

This folder owns reusable Node.js helpers and their unit tests for repository
tooling.

- `local-supabase-status.mjs` reads and validates project-scoped Supabase CLI
  status without exposing credentials.
- `local-authenticated-user.mjs` completes local Mailpit OTP authentication and
  returns a separate data client whose access-token callback is bound to the
  verified session JWT. This prevents immediate REST/RPC calls from falling
  back to the publishable key as their Bearer value.
- `demo-world.mjs` owns the stable synthetic persona/scenario registry, strict
  loopback-only target guard, time-relative dataset orchestration, and focused
  verification for the explicit local demo-data commands.
- `validation-paths.mjs` maps changed repository paths to the Mobile, Web, Site,
  and Database CI areas. Its tests protect the conservative shared-path and
  documentation-only boundaries used by the validation workflow.
- The matching `*.test.mjs` files verify parsing and request authentication
  behavior or path classification with non-secret fixtures.

The authenticated-user helper is local integration tooling only. It must never
log OTPs, access or refresh tokens, API keys, Authorization headers, or database
credentials.

The demo-world helper is also trusted local tooling. It uses ordinary
authenticated clients for domain mutations, the service role only for the
existing notification projector, and a direct local PostgreSQL connection only
for coordination, stable lookups, verification, and refreshing the timestamps
of the naturally aged historical Proposal.
